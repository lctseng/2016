    subject: "How we replaced salary negotiations with a Sinatra app"
    summary: "Let's talk about salaries, diversity, career development, getting compensated in gold and silver, paying taxes in livestock and Ruby code.
We at Travis CI have been working on a new salary system to determine how much we pay whom, when employees get raises and a whole range of other things. After lots of back and forth, we ended up with a Sinatra application to solve salary questions.
Expect to explore the topic from many different angles and levels. We'll look at decisions, realisations and implications, as well as interesting parts of the implementation."

    subject: "Ruby, facing the change of world-wide server-class microprocessors"
    summary: "隨著物聯網與雲端服務的盛行，傳統的 server class microprocessor 逐漸地從 general propose 轉變成為 workload specific；雲端服務採購 workload specific processor 的比重從 2010 年 9% 提升到今年至少 30%，比重逐年增加。為了因應 workload specific processor，許多程式語言都逐漸從 interpreter base、JIT base 轉向到 compiler base。Ruby language 的架構是採用純 interpreter base，致使 Skymizer 在針對客戶 workload 優化時，遭遇許多困難。

本篇 talk 會指出 Ruby langauge 現行 VM 上設計的問題，說明為何其無法針對客戶 workload 進行客製化，以期之後社群的努力與改進。"
